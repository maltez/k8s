The task

The task is to write the Kubernetes deployment manifests to run Docker registry in Kubernetes
with at least the following - deployment, service, persistent volume claim, garbage collect cron
job, ingress, secret (if needed).

Make sure Docker registry uses Redis for cache and you run 2 replicas of Docker registry for
redundancy.
